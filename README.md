# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to extract and analyze data from a relational database using SQL. The goal is to apply core SQL techniques to explore, manipulate, and gain insights from a dataset.

---

## Tools Used
- SQL Engine: **PostgreSQL**
- SQL Editor - pgAdmin 
- Dataset: eshop dataset
---

## SQL Features Used

### Data Retrieval & Filtering
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`

### Table Relationships & Joins
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`

### Advanced Queries
- Subqueries (both correlated and non-correlated)
- Aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`

### Views
- Created views to simplify recurring analysis queries

### Query Optimization
- Created indexes to improve performance on frequently filtered/joined columns

## Screenshots of SQL outputs are included in the repository, showcasing the results of key queries.


## Steps:
1. Load the dataset into your SQL engine (PostgreSQL).
2. Open `SQL_queries.sql` in your SQL editor.
3. Run queries section by section to view results.
4. Use the screenshots for reference and validation.
